# NiftyNovelCrawler
This script, named NiftyNovelCrawler, crawls novel information and chapter content from Nifty.org. It checks the local cache first, and if not found, fetches from the web and saves to the cache. It extracts the novel's name, author, publication date, update date, and chapter list, saving this information and content into an HTML file.

If you find this script useful, please consider supporting the Nifty website.
